TwitterDataCollector
====================

02/26/2014:
This is the initial phase of Sentiment Analysis tool. 
Goals of initial phase:
Step 1:Develop a simple module to consume live twitter data and save it to local filesystem in the form of a text file.
Step 2:Process the file using PigLatin
Step 3:Develop a sentiment analysis module and run it using YARN/ MapReduce

Status as of 02/26/2014:
Step 1:Implemented
Step 2:To be started
Step 3:Design ready

Steps to run step 1:
Run the TwitterStream-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:
java -cp TwitterStream-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.twitter.stream.UI
You will get the 2 swing UIs (screenshot 1 and screenshot 2) on your screen. Enter the details asked in screenshot 1.
Note that you need to have a twitter application registered to get your own credentials(or use mine if they are still 
valid). Let the process run in the backgroud and then enjoy the live twitter feeds saved on your local filesystem. 

I recently used this to pull live twitter data during the superbowl match. Once step 3 is complete I plan to analyze the
sentiments of Broncos supporters :)
